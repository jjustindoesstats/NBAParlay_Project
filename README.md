# NBAParlay_Project
A continuous summer project in collaboration with Richard Shafie (Sports Strategist).   The goal is to pull data from Basketballreference and analyze the data using SQL and Tableau.  Using Dashboards, I will visualize the risk and payoff of parlay bets.  This project will require several key deliverables.  First, a general webscrapping function done in python to easily extract data from BBall reference and convert it into an excel spreadsheet.  Second, the numerous Tableau dashboards that must be created.  This project is in progress, and by the end of the NBA playoffs, I will create a dashboard to demonstrate our performance.
